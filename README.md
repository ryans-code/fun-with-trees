A makefile is included for Linux users. Navigate to directory and run 'make' to auto-compile files, then run with './a.out'

Note: when displaying the tree you will see a result similar to the following;

Be aware that the root is located on the left-most side of the console and children nodes extend toward the right side.

This is the same tree imaged above but with additional markup:

Also note, this is a randomized tree before the sort function has been called on the tree.
